# Heap simulator
Greetings! 

This is a project developed for Professor Baz√≠lio's classes. It's a heap simulator, which means that it simulates how a memory heap works. You also can manipulate it to check on more details.

###### How to run it
You can start the program with a .txt file, which has specific instructions. You will find two files in this repository as an example. If you want to write your own file with different commands, just tell the project to: 

1) Add a new element using the command: *new [name of the variable] *[size of the variable]*
2) Delete an element using the command: *del [name of the variable]*
3) Show what you acquired in your memory heap using the command: *exibe*
4)  To assign a given variable to another, use the command: *[name of the first variable] = [name of the second variable]*
5) To change the inserting heap mode, use the command: *heap [heap mode]* (four options: first, best, worst, and next).

Start from manual mode if you don't have a file yet, or if you want to introduce changes on the memory heap.  Manual mode is triggered by typing 1, and exits by typing 2. The manual mode offers six command options:
- Type *1* to add a new element; enter the name of the variable and its size 
- Type *2* to delete an element, entering the variable name
- Type *3* to change the inserting heap mode, choosing between the available alternatives: first, best, worst, or next.
- Type *4* to assign a variable to another, entering both variables names
- Type *5* to exit the program
- Type *6* to clear your screen, and keep running the program from a fresh, cleared screen.

## Final thoughts 
Any help or comment will be highly appreciated. Thanks for reading!
